ModCloth Docker Layers
======================

This is a collection of layers meant to be published to ModCloth's Docker
Registry.  Nothing in here should be anything like an "application container",
but instead just foundational layers.  Because of this layered relationship, the
directories in this repository are nested accordingly.  In order to get an idea
of the hierarchy, perhaps use a tool like `tree` (which is `brew`-installable)
like so:

``` bash
tree -C
```

## Initial Vagrant setup

This repository contains a `Vagrantfile` at the top level which is meant to be
used to create a Linux VM environment in which `docker` can be used.  [Install
vagrant here](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.3.3), then do this:

``` bash
vagrant up
```

If anything explodes, you should [yell at someone](mailto:d.buch@modcloth.com).

## Building images
Each directory contains a `Makefile` (based on
[/.tmpl/Makefile](.tmpl/Makefile)) which may be used to build images from the
`Dockerfile`s found throughout:

``` bash
# Move into a directory containing a Dockerfile
cd /vagrant/build-essential/nodejs

# Build the container
make container
```

## Pushing images

Once the images are built, they should be uploaded to the ModCloth Docker
Registry at `quay.io/modcloth` using `docker push` (after `docker login`)
like so:

``` bash
# Make sure you're logged into the ModCloth Docker Registry
sudo docker login quay.io

# Enter username, password, email # after which there will be
# a ~/.dockercfg containing the auth JSON.

# Push an image by "repository name".  All tags for the image will also be pushed.
sudo docker push quay.io/modcloth/nodejs
```
